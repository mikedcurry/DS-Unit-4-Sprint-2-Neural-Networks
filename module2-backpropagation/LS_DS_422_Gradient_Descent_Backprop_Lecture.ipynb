Do you think our neural network needs to look at all 6000 number 3s in order to get an idea of how accurate or innacurate it is at recognizing the number 3? No, it doesn't.

Our purpose today is to demonstrate the backpropagation algorithm on a simple Feedforward Neural Network and in so doing help you get a grasp on the main process. If you want to understand all of the underlying calculus of how the gradients are calculated then you'll need to dive into it yourself, [3Blue1Brown's video is a great starting place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8). I also highly recommend this Welch Labs series [Neural Networks Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxe2T-V8XRs) if you want a rapid yet orderly walkthrough of the main intuitions and math behind the backpropagation algorithm.
